<h4>Potential side-effects from chemotherapy.</h4>
<p>People like you experience problems from chemotherapy, which have a big impact on their lifestyles.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cancer cells. But when the drugs travel throughout
the body they affect healthy cells as well. The side effects related to chemotherapy
are caused by the damage of these healthy cells. The side effects can vary,
depending on the drug or combination of them. However, the most common ones people
in the same risk group as yours might experience are listed here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nausea/vomiting. </strong> When chemotherapy drugs enter the body, sensors
in the digestive system and brain detect that it is a foreign substance, and your
body try to get rid of this foreign substances. Sometimes accute nausea and vomiting can be
experienced on the day of chemotherapy and sometimes several days after.
You would get the medicines to prevent vomiting, however Refractory
vomiting might also take place as a side effect from chemotherapy. Refractory vomiting is when
the medicamentations are given to you to prevent vomiting and nausea but they appear to not work.
This means that your nausea and vomiting have become refractory or no longer respond to the drugs you’re getting to prevent it.
Refractory vomiting may be caused after a few or even several chemo treatments. </li>
<br>
<li><strong>Diarrhea.</strong> Diarrhea is the common side effect of chemotherapy. The
Abdominal cramping is an early sign that diarrhea is complicated and needs aggressive treatment.
Diahrrea leads to depletion of fluids and electrolytes and dehydration, which might cause hospitalization.
The severity of diahrrea might vary and in some cases raise up to 6 stools per day.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Appetite loss. </strong> Chemotherapy may affect your eating habbits
and cause appetite loss. This can lead to weight loss and depression. Other
things, such as trouble swallowing, pain, nausea, or vomiting can
decrease your appetite as well.  </li>
<br>
<li><strong>Insomnia.</strong> Sleep problems such as being unable to fall asleep and/or stay asleep,
also called insomnia, are common in your risk group. Long-term insomnia might also
cause depression and icrease anxiety.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Fatigue. </strong> The cancer related fatigue is different from the fatigue
in daily life. It can be described as feeling weak, listless, drained, or “washed out.”
Some people even feel tired to eat or go to the bathroom. Rest or sleep might not help and
any type of activity can be exhausting. You may feel week and low on energy and can't
concentrate or focus on things. This may also affect your work or social life. Most often
cancer related fatigue is provoked by anemia (low blood cell count), which is caused by
chemotherapy and cancer itself. If chemotherapy is given in cycles, fatigue will get worse
towards the later cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some side effects disappear quite quickly, but for some of them it can take months
or years to disappear completely. While side effects can be unpleasant, they must
be accessed against the need to kill the cancer cells. The visualizations below might
help you to imagine how many people in the same risk group experience these particular
side effects. You can interact with the visualizations and receive information in different
formats.</p>


<!-- BarChart code -->

<br><br>
<h4>Imagine that there are 100 people and some of them experience different side
  effects from chemotherapy. This bar chart allows you to see how many people out of 100
  from your risk group experience different side effects. If you do not want to  see some factors
or you want to decrease or increase the frequency scale, use the slider.</h4>
